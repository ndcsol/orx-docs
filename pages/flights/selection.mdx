# Querying Flights

Now that you have initiated a flight search; and, received a session public ID in response, you are ready to query and select individual flights.

## Querying and Selection Order

### Flights Querying Order

> ðŸ§¨ It is important to keep in mind that not **all fares provided are combinable**. When querying bound 0 and selecting a fare and brand, querying bound 1 will only yield compatible results. Therefore, it is advised that you query each bound after selecting bounds prior to it to ensure compatibility of all results.

---

### Flights Selection Order

> ðŸ§¨ It is also important to note that **flight selection needs to happen in order**. If someone re-selects a bound, the following bounds will be de-selected.

## Querying Flights

`GET /flight/[sessionId]/bound/[boundIndex]`

This endpoint is used to query individual flights, where `[sessionId]` is the public session ID, and `[bound]` is the index of the bound being queried, starting from 0.
