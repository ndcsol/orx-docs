# Introduction

The ORX API follows a RESTful architecture, featuring well-defined URLs for its resources, support for form-encoded request payloads, and response data formatted in JSON. Additionally, it utilizes standard HTTP verbs, authentication protocols, and HTTP response codes.

## Sandbox Environments

Utilizing the ORX API Sandbox mode allows for experimentation without any impact on your live data or real travel vendors. The API key and the target endpoints for authentication decides whether the request will operate in live or test mode.

> ðŸ›Ž The Sandbox environment connects to our vendors' test environments. The travel test environments are often not stable and may not always return proper result. We will do our best to keep the Sandbox stable, but we cannot guarantee the stability of our vendors' test environments.
