# Ordering Flights

Once you have selected your flights, added the necessary ancillaries, and obtained the pricing information, you can proceed to place an order for the selected itinerary. This step finalizes the booking process and requires providing payment information.

## Requesting Order

`POST /flight/[sessionId]/order`

Use this endpoint to place an order for the selected flights using the specified payment details. See [Payment Initialization](/versions/v1/payment/initiate) to understand the tokenization process.

> 🧨 The endpoint requires a payment method, including a TokenEx token which has been tokenized with its [CVV/CVC attached to it](https://docs.tokenex.com/docs/pci-w-cvv-configuration).
