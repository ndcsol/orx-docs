# Pricing Flights

Once we have selected out flights, and optionally selected our ancillaries, we can proceed to pricing our flights. This step is required, and works towards confirming the price of the flights, and ensuring that the flights are still available. By this points, you should have also added the required passenger information to the session.

## Passenger Requirements

By this point, all [Passenger](/versions/v1/glossary#passenger-information) need to have a complete `personal_info` object. At least one adult passenger needs to have their `email` and `phone_number` set.

> üß® If the passenger requirements are not met by this point, the request will return validation errors for the passengers.

> üõé We highly recommend that you input the `email` and the `phone_number` for **all adult passengers**.

## Requesting Pricing

`GET /flight/[sessionId]/price`

The endpoint will return the pricing information for the selected flights, and will also return the total price of the flights, including the ancillaries. If the price has changed, the response will contain the new price, and a property acknowledging the change.

> üß® If there was any problems with the combination of flights, or the ancillaries, this is likely where the chicken üêì will come home to roost. If you have any issues, you should check the response for any errors, and then try to reselect the flights, or ancillaries.
