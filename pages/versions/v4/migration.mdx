# Migrating to v4

This guide outlines the key changes introduced in the latest version of ORX. If you're upgrading from a previous version, please read this carefully to avoid unexpected behavior in production.

---

## ⚠️ Breaking Changes

### Prefer Flag Defaults Changing

The default values of certain `prefer` flags have changed. These are now **enabled by default**, whereas they used to be opt-in:

* `error-reason-codes`: `false` → `true`
* `dynamic-session-expiry`: `false` → `true`
* `three-ds`: `false` → `true`

You can still override these flags back to `false` by explicitly setting them in your requests.

---

### Initializing the SDK

The SDK now requires explicit initialization via the `GET /sdk` endpoint. You must first call this endpoint, then pass its response to the `load` method of the SDK. 

Previously, the `threeDs` method could be called directly using the payload returned from the `/order` endpoint.

---

### Order Rejection on Payment Risk

Orders with high-risk payments may now be rejected **before** 3DS is offered. When this happens, the API will return an error with the reason code `ORX_PAYMENT_REJECTED`.

You must handle this error on the frontend or product side. Previously, all orders would either succeed or initiate 3DS.

## ✅ Non-breaking Changes

### Commission Details in Pricing

The pricing endpoint now includes additional commission-related fields:

* Estimated commission
* Explanation of how the estimate was calculated

### 3DS Data in `/retrieve`

The `/retrieve` endpoint may now return a `paymentAuthorization` object, which could details details about any possible 3DS workflow associated with the order.

### 3. Risk Evaluation in `/retrieve`

The `/retrieve` endpoint may also include a new `riskEvaluation` field, including Stripe Radar's risk evaluation.
