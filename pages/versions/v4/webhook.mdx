# Webhooks

ORX provides a webhook mechanism to notify clients about important events in the flight booking process.

## Webhook Events

The webhook supports the following event types:

- `FLIGHT_BOOKING_QUEUED`: Triggered when a flight booking request is initially processed and queued.
- `FLIGHT_BOOKING_ISSUED`: Triggered when a flight booking is successfully issued.
- `FLIGHT_BOOKING_CANCELLED`: Triggered when a flight booking is cancelled.

## Payload Structure

```json
{
  "session": Session,
  "eventType": "FLIGHT_BOOKING_QUEUED" | "FLIGHT_BOOKING_ISSUED" | "FLIGHT_BOOKING_CANCELLED"
}
```

- `eventType`: (`FLIGHT_BOOKING_QUEUED` | `FLIGHT_BOOKING_ISSUED` | `FLIGHT_BOOKING_CANCELLED`) The event that occured.
- `session`: ([Session](/versions/v3/glossary#session)) the session object concerned with the event.    

## Response

Your webhook endpoint **must** return a 200 (OK) status code to indicate successful processing of the webhook event. Any response other than a 200 status code will be considered a failed delivery.

> ðŸ”” If your webhook endpoint does not return a 200 status code, our API will retry the call up to 10 times using an exponential backoff pattern. 

## Security

### Webhook Secret Verification

To ensure the authenticity of webhook requests, we will provide you with a secret during webhook configuration. Each webhook request will include an `x-webhook-secret` header, containing SHA-256 hash of the secret.
