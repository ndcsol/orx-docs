# Browser SDK

The `@ndcsol/orx` SDK is a utility to provide support for browser-related features.  

## SDK Overview

Before being able to use the SDK, you need to call the `load` method of the SDK.  

### Get SDK Load Payload

This endpoint returns the payload required to load the SDK. You will need to pass the returned payload to the `load` method of the SDK in the browser. Exposing the payload to the client is completely safe. 


`GET /sdk`

> ðŸ›Ž Since this data is technically static, it may be aggressively cached. We recommend employing a stale-while-revalidate strategy to ensure that the payload is always up to date.

#### Response Example

```json filename="GET /sdk" copy
{
    "gateway": "stripe",
    "payload": {
        "publishable_key": "pk_test_sdfjsldkfjlsd"
    }
}
```
The response will of type [SDK Load Payload](/versions/v5/glossary#sdk-load-payload).

#### possible errors

| status code | error | reason | reason code |
|---|---|---|---|
| 400 | authentication failure | 3d secure authentication failed. | |

### Loading the SDK

```bash copy
npm install @ndcsol/orx@5
```

```ts copy
import { load } from '@ndcsol/orx';

// Call from your backend
const loadInfo = await (await fetch('/sdk')).json();

const { instance, error } = await load(loadInfo);

if(error){
  //handle initiation error
}

const threeDsResult = await instance.threeDs(threeDsActionObject);
const context = await instance.createContext();
```

If no error is returned, you may safely assume that the `instance` property is available.
