# Migrating to v5

ORX API v5 maintains full backward compatibility with v4. All existing flight booking functionality works unchanged.

## Migration Steps

### 1. Update Client SDK
```bash
npm install @ndcsol/orx@^5.0.0
```

### 2. Update API Version Header
```bash
x-api-version: 5
```

### 3. Update Webhook Handlers
v5 introduces new webhook events for hotel bookings. Update your webhook endpoints to handle:
* `HOTEL_BOOKING_ISSUED` - Hotel booking confirmed
* `HOTEL_BOOKING_CANCELLED` - Hotel booking cancelled

ðŸ”— [Webhook Events](/versions/v5/webhook)

## New in v5

### Hotel Booking System
Complete hotel booking functionality alongside flights:

* **Search & Details**: Location search, property details, room selection
* **Booking Flow**: Pricing, ordering, retrieval, cancellation
* **Session Types**: `HOTEL` (search) and `HOTEL_BOOKING` (booking) sessions
